Developed a crowdfunding platform using the MERN stack, leveraging React.js with hooks and the Context API for dynamic, responsive user interfaces.

Ethereum smart contracts were deployed, written in Solidity using Remix IDE and Web3.js, enabling secure and transparent blockchain transactions.

Firebase Authentication, integrated with OAuth 2.0, ensured secure user login while providing real-time data synchronization, reducing onboarding time by 40% and enhancing user retention.

To gather and process user feedback efficiently, a system was implemented using TypeScript and GraphQL for fast data querying, while AWS Lambda was utilized for real-time feedback processing.

This integration led to a significant increase in user engagement, boosting participation by 50%.

The platform's combination of secure blockchain features, real-time data handling, and smooth user experience contributed to a more interactive and engaging crowdfunding environment, providing users with an intuitive and secure platform for contributing to various projects.

This project not only improved technical skills in smart contracts, front-end development, and cloud services but also highlighted the impact of seamless user experience on platform success.
